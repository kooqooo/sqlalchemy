    Adjusted the test suite as well as the ORM's method of scanning classes for
    annotations to work under current beta releases of Python 3.14 (currently
    3.14.0b1) as part of an ongoing effort to support the production release of
    this Python release.  Further changes to Python's means of working with
    annotations is expected in subsequent beta releases for which SQLAlchemy's
    test suite will need further adjustments.
