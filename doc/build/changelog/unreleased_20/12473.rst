    Fixed regression in ORM Annotated Declarative class interpretation caused
    by ``typing_extension==4.13.0`` that introduced a different implementation
    for ``TypeAliasType`` while SQLAlchemy assumed that it would be equivalent
    to the ``typing`` version, leading to pep-695 type annotations not
    resolving to SQL types as expected.
