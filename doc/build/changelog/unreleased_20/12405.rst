    Changes to the test suite to accommodate Python 3.14 and its new
    implementation of :pep:`649`, which highly modifies how typing annotations
    are interpreted at runtime.  Use of the new
    ``annotationlib.get_annotations()`` function is enabled when python 3.14 is
    present, and many other changes to how pep-484 type objects are interpreted
    at runtime are made.
