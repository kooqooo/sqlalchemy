    Backported to SQLAlchemy 1.4 an improvement to the test suite with regards
    to how asyncio related tests are run, now using the newer Python 3.11
    ``asyncio.Runner`` or a backported equivalent, rather than relying on the
    previous implementation based on ``asyncio.get_event_loop()``.  This allows
    the SQLAlchemy 1.4 codebase to run on Python 3.14 which has removed this
    method.  Pull request courtesy Nils Philippsen.
